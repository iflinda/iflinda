Hi. I'm Linda, and I'm enrolled in the Full-stack Web Development Diploma Program at the British Columbia Institute of Technology located in Vancouver, BC in Canada. I'll be graduating in April 2022. 

I'm passionate about front-end and back-end development. I enjoy designing, developing, and deploying small personal projects. As a result, I'm constantly trying to learn more about the field. I love joining extracurricular activities (solo or in a team) to meet new people while developing my skills as a Full-stack Developer. 

Furthermore, I'm a firm believer in open source projects and giving back to the community. I love how a community of people worldwide can collaborate on amazing projects.
